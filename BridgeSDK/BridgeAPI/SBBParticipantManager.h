 Update the user's dataGroups to the Bridge API.
 
 This method writes a StudyParticipant record consisting of just the dataGroups field to the Bridge server.
 You may set the dataGroups directly as part of the StudyParticipant record when signing up for a Bridge account,
 but afterward should always update them via this method or one of the convenience methods that calls it
 (see note below about cached scheduled activities).
 
 @note If using caching, be aware that calling this method (or any of the convenience methods which call it) will remove unexpired, unfinished scheduled activities from the cache. The next call to get scheduled activities will replace them with the correct schedule going forward for the new set of data groups. If you're not using the SDK's built-in caching, you will need to take care of this yourself.

If there is an error fetching the user's existing dataGroups, that error will be passed to the completion handler. If an attempt is made to add a user to one or more data groups that haven't first been defined in the study, the Bridge API will respond with 400 (Bad Request) with an error message detailing the problem in the body of the response.
